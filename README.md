pyTABARI
========

This project aims to be the Python rewrite of Phil Schrodt's 
[TABARI](http://eventdata.psu.edu/software.dir/tabari.html) program.
In addition to rewriting the basic parsing functionality in Python, this 
project aims to add other features, such as the geolocation of events and
feature extraction, to the program. An additional feature is baked-in 
parallelization of the processing of sentences and files. 

##Progress

The project will likely proceed in two parts:

1) Writing out the new features like geolocation
2) Rewriting the parser in Python

Currently the project is in the first part. The current code is a rough
sketch of the code for this stage.
